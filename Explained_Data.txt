LANDUSE TYPE    :

- poorrange         : Likely refers to land with low-quality vegetation that may be used for grazing but doesn't support robust livestock activity.

- mix(woodland_x)   : A mixed-use area that includes woodland and other unspecified land uses ('x' might stand for variable or unknown uses).

- rock              : Land primarily characterized by exposed rock surfaces, with little to no vegetation.

- mix(bareland_x)   : A combination of bare land (land without significant vegetation or structures) and other land uses.

- verylowforest     : Areas with very sparse forest coverage.

- lowforest         : Forests with low density of trees.

- woodland1         : A type of land dominated by trees and shrubbery; the '1' might distinguish it from other types of woodland within the dataset.

- bareland          : Land without significant vegetation, buildings, or other structures.

- modrange          : Moderate-quality range land that could be used for grazing.

- mix(poorrange_x)  : Mixed land use that includes poor-quality range land and other uses.

- mix(lowforest_x)  : Mixed land use including low-density forests and other unspecified uses.

- agri              : Agricultural land used for growing crops or livestock.

- masil             : Farm - a tract of land with associated buildings devoted to agriculture

- modforest         : Moderate-density forest.

- mix(modforest_x)  : Mixed use that includes moderate-density forest and other uses.

- mix(dryfarming_x) : Mixed land use that includes dry farming (agricultural techniques for non-irrigated farming) and other uses.

- mix(modrange_x)   : Mixed use including moderate-quality range land and other uses.

- mix(agri_X)       : Mixed agricultural land with other unspecified uses.

- bagh/grazing area : 'Bagh' might refer to orchards or gardens in some languages, combined with grazing land.

- goodrange         : High-quality grazing land.

- woodland2         : Another category of woodland, likely with distinct characteristics from 'woodland1'.

- urban             : Areas with high density of buildings, infrastructure, and human activity.

- mix(bagh_X)       : Mixed use including orchards or gardens and other unspecified uses.

- mix(agri_dryfarming): Mixed agricultural use, combining standard agriculture and dry farming.

- denseforest       : Forest with a high density of trees.

- mix(agri_bagh)    : Mixed use including agricultural land and orchards/gardens.

- dryfarming        : Agricultural methods used in areas with little rainfall, relying on moisture conservation.

- follow            : This might be a typo for 'fallow', which refers to agricultural land left to rest and not seeded for one or more growing seasons.

- mix(goodrang_x)   : Mixed use including high-quality range land and other uses.

- mix(follow_x)     : Mixed use including fallow land and other unspecified uses.

- saltland          : Land with high soil salinity, often unsuitable for standard agriculture.

- mix(verylowforest_x): Mixed use including very sparse forests and other uses.

- wetland1          : Land with high levels of moisture, like swamps or marshes, which could support a diverse ecosystem.

- water             : Areas covered by water bodies like lakes, rivers, or ponds.

- mix(denseforest_x): Mixed use that includes dense forests and other unspecified uses.
